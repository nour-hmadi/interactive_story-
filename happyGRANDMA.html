    i am a happy GRANDMA
    Path2
    It was a nostalgia when Jane told her grandmother about the book
    Her grandmother felt like she wants to read that book for Jane 
    They went together back to the book
    She opened the book as it is a fairy tale, 
    She said secret words suddenly the old library smells like a green heaven, rives and waterfalls, birds and ducks all around, the clear blue sky,
    some one was calling on her 
    she was following the voice until she

    1- reached the unexpected end
    2-the happy unexpected end
