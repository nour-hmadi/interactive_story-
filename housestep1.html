        distracted by a ladybug inside the room. <br><br>She kept following it.
         Meanwhile a cat
        jumped into the opposite window. The cat looked hungry and Jane wanted 
        to help her. She tried to open the window a bit; however, the cat 
        immediately swept through the windows opening into the house, to the 
        ground floor, and hide between a group of books.
