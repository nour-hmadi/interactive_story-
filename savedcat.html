        she followed the butterfly because she thought and maybe believed that the butterfly
        wants to lead her into something she must know. Yes, Jane was right, the butterfly parked at the keys!! Jane was amazed, it was totally unbelievable how magic is spreading all over the house. She took the keys, and headed to the stellar to let the cat out,
        but the book is shining like a star in the night sky, and the butterfly again is there too!<br>
        There should be onething to understand, that Jane must read take the book. She opened the book. She was very excited and at the same worried about what's next.
        "a green land, rivers and waterfalls, unicorns and angels" that what she lastly read before her life stepped into that nature.
        she was called the queen of the stars in that world. However, that book was the gate to the queens to get back to their kingdoms
        Jane was the queen os stars!
